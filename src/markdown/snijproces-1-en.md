The MULTICRACKER® is a compact machine which can be used to minimize the size of your product, through the process of 'cracking' rather than milling.<br />
<br />
In this machine, we use specially patented cracking discs which reduce the size of your material under high speed to your desired dimensions. With the blades, the MULTICRACKER® effectively works using a scissor mechanism, leading to the optimal dimensions of your product.<br />
<br />
The diagrams below show that the cutting surface of a MULTICRACKER® is three times larger than that of a mill of equal size, leading to a capacity three times greater.
