## Why 'cracking' (breaking) instead of milling?
By cracking the product, a uniform product size is obtained. In the case of animal feed, this has a positive effect on the digestion of the animal.<br />
<br />
Due to the fast throughput of the machine, the product does not experience any increase in temperature and therefore minimal loss of moisture and nutritional value.<br />
<br />
