With the blades, the MULTICRACKER® effectively works using a scissor mechanism, leading to the optimal dimensions of your product.<br />\n<br />\nThe diagrams below show that the cutting surface of a MULTICRACKER® is three times larger than that of a mill of equal size, leading to a capacity three times greater.</p>"},"markdown2":{"html":"<h2>Why 'cracking' (breaking) instead of milling?</h2>\n<p>By cracking the product, a uniform product size is obtained.
